# summary of insight
After analyzing the provided dinosaur data, I gathered several insights regarding the diversity, size, and temporal distribution of dinosaurs such as:
1) Diversity: The dataset contains a diverse range of up to 1042 dinosaur species.
2) Largest Species: The largest dinosaur recorded is Supersaurus with a maximum head to tail length of 35.0 meters.
3) Temporal analysis: The trend line in the scatter plot indicates a slight decrease in dinosaur size over time, but the variation in sizes and the relatively shallow slope of the trend line suggest that size was not solely dependent on the age of the fossils. This complexity highlights the need for further investigation into the factors influencing dinosaur size throughout different geological periods.
